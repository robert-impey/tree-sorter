# tree-sorter

Program for sorting space indented text, treating blocks indented to the same level as groups. This is useful for grouping items in a "to do" list.

e.g.

    II Animals
      2 Dogs
      3 Cats
      1 Fish
    I Plants
      b Nettles
      c Oak
      a Grass
  
becomes

    I Plants
      a Grass
      b Nettles
      c Oak
    II Animals
      1 Fish
      2 Dogs
      3 Cats
      
Trees of grouped data can be of arbitrary depth.

## Usage

    $ ./treesorter.py -h
    usage: Sort trees [-h] [--SeparateTopLevel] [--InPlace] TreeFile

    positional arguments:
      TreeFile            The file containing the tree.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help          show this help message and exit
      --SeparateTopLevel  Separate top level trees with a blank line.
      --InPlace           Write the output on top of the input file.

### Examples

The input file might contain a few trees in no particular order:

    $ cat fixtures/two-deep-with-gaps.txt
    1 one
        i one
        iii one
        ii one

    3 three
        iii three
        i three
        ii three

    2 two
        ii two
        iii two
        i two

The tool reads the contents of the text file and prints out the trees in order.

    $ ./treesorter.py fixtures/two-deep-with-gaps.txt
    1 one
        i one
        ii one
        iii one
    2 two
        i two
        ii two
        iii two
    3 three
        i three
        ii three
        iii three

The --SeparateTopLevel puts a blank line between "top level" trees. This is useful for navigating between groups nimbly in vim.

    $ ./treesorter.py fixtures/two-deep-with-gaps.txt --SeparateTopLevel
    1 one
        i one
        ii one
        iii one

    2 two
        i two
        ii two
        iii two

    3 three
        i three
        ii three
        iii three
        
The --InPlace flag writes the sorted trees on top of the input file. 

    $ ./treesorter.py ~/docs/todo.txt --SeparateTopLevel --InPlace

In this case, the tool creates a back up file with the extension ".bak" first. Obviously, you've already got other back ups anyway. This is free software. I take no respobsibility for anything that happens to your files. See license.
